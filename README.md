### Start the cafe day

1. Start by stocking up on ingredients in your Inventory.
   ![Shopping page](frontend/src/assets/platform/shopping.png)
2. Head over to the Kitchen, where you can add ingredients into slots. You‚Äôll need at least two to make something tasty.

   > Pro tip: Not all foods require 3 ingredients!
3. Click **Combine** and voil√†! Your new dish is ready to serve! It‚Äôs automatically added to your Menu.

   Fret not if your combo doesn't make something on the menu, you'll still receive a bowl of kibbles!

   > Tip: Make something available on the menu to gain more points when serving them!
4. Once you have successfully made a dish, don't forget to log it down in your recipes page!

5. Feed pets from the menu to earn hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è and coins ü™ô. Stats update immediately in your caf√© banner so you always know how well you‚Äôre doing.

   No matter what you feed the pets, they will always love you back!

6. Admins get a special **Admin Panel** tab where they can select users and grant bonus points (because sometimes caf√© managers need a little help üòâ).
